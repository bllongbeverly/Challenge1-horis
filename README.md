## Refactoring Challenge

## Description
This is a refactoring challenge where semantic HTML elements, logical structure, alt attributes, sequential order, and a concise, descriptive title were implemented to create a seamless HTML and CSS application.

## Usage
Refactoring as to improve operation without altering functionality. "developers might be asked to review the architecture and, where possible, refactor code to create smaller and more manageable components"
